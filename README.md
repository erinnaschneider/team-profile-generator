# Team Profile Generator

## Overview:
A program that generates an HTML page, based on the user's inputs, of a basic work team structure. The prompts begin with questions for a team's manager and asks for: 
  * Name
  * Employee number
  * Email address
  * Office number

Once the manager has answered all of the prompts, they can choose to add an employee. 

The option of adding an engineer asks for:
  * Name
  * Employee number
  * Email address
  * Github username
   * Clicking on the Github username will take you to that employee's profile page.

The option of adding an intern asks for:
  * Name
  * Employee number
  * Email address
  * School name

Checks are put in place so that there can be no duplicates for employee number, email address, nor Github username.

Add as many employees as you need to fill out your team's profile!
